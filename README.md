Program Idea <br>
Idea is a Media Library. It should have a number of Shelves that each hold a different type of Media – video games, movies, music, tv shows, books. <br><br>
What classes will be used <br>
Media parent class<br>
Child classes: Movie, Video Game, Music, Tv Show, Book<br>
Shelf class (holds one type of Media)<br><br>
Functions that will be needed<br>
Media – accessors/mutators for title, year published, file size, cost(?)<br>
Movie – a/m for Length, times played<br>
Music – a/m Length, times played<br>
Video Game – a/m hours played<br>
Tv Show – a/m Episodes, times played<br>
Book -- a/m pageCount (instead of size), times read
Times played mutator should increment by 1, hours played should add some amount<br>
Shelf – Media type, add media, size of shelf, remove media<br><br>
Program Flow<br>
“GitHub Flow” – a main branch, pull off a feature branch to build a feature, merge back to main when done.<br>
