Idea is a Media Library. It should have a number of Shelves that each hold a different type of Media – video games, movies, music, tv shows. 
What classes will be used
Media parent class
Child classes: Movie, Video Game, Music, Tv Show
Shelf class (holds one type of Media)

Media – accessors/mutators for title, year published, file size, cost(?)
Movie – a/m for Length, times played
Music – a/m Length, times played
Video Game – a/m hours played
Tv Show – a/m Episodes, times played
Times played mutator should increment by 1, hours played should add some amount
Shelf – Media type, add media, size of shelf, remove media
Program Flow
“GitHub Flow” – a main branch, pull off a feature branch to build a feature, merge back to main when done.
